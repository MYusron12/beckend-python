# Backend Python

This repository contains a backend project implemented using Python. It serves as a basic template or starting point for building backend applications with Python.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical backend architecture, including:

- **app.py**: Main entry point for the application.
- **config.py**: Configuration file for environment variables and settings.
- **controllers/**: Contains logic for handling API requests.
- **models/**: Defines the data models for the application.
- **viewmodels/**: Provides the data formatting for the views.
- **views/**: Templates for rendering the frontend (if applicable).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MYusron12/beckend-python.git

   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
